# Blackjack! v1.0

Welcome to my Blackjack game! This is my first stab at a true card game. It's not perfect but I've learned a lot from building this. 

## Technologies Used

This is solely compiled using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I tried to create this without using jQuery, to hone my JavaScript skills.


### Let's Play!

It's a very quick and simple playthrough, but some of the best things in life are the simple things. I hope you enjoy!


There are three steps to play:

- First, press the START button on the top left of the screen.

- Next, view your scores at the bottom of the screen to determine your next move.

- Use HIT or STAND to play through the hands until a winner is decided. Your cards will be displayed as their text values (Clubs K, Diamonds 7, etc.).

You will be prompted on whether you or the dealer has won.

#### Next Steps 

Updates to the game coming in v1.1, scheduled to release later this year. The release of v1.0 was to build a working game before adding further functionality. Planned functionality for v1.1 includes:

- Functional betting tool. 

- "7 of Spades", "K of Hearts" etc displaying. Possibly images of cards instead. 

- Dealer will stand after placing score of 17.


#### That's all, folks!

Thank you for playing, reading, and please feel free to fork the game and push me any improvements you think would make this game awesome!!

Best,
